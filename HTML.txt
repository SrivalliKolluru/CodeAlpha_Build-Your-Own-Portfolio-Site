  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I am a recent Computer Science and Engineering graduate with a strong passion for 
  technology, problem-solving, and continuous learning. Throughout my academic journey, 
  I have built a solid foundation in programming languages like Java, Python, and C++, 
  along with hands-on experience in web development, data structures, algorithms, and 
  database management. I have worked on academic and personal projects that reflect my 
  ability to apply theoretical concepts to real-world solutions. As a quick learner and 
  team player, I am eager to begin my professional journey in a challenging and 
  growth-oriented environment where I can contribute to innovative software development 
  and keep evolving as a tech professional..</p>

      <h3>IoT-based Smart Cradle</h3>
      <p>An IoT-based Smart Cradle is designed to monitor and soothe infants 
      automatically. It includes sensors to detect baby movement, crying, 
      temperature, and humidity. When the baby cries, the cradle can rock 
      gently and alert parents via a connected mobile app. It ensures real-time 
      health and environment monitoring for newborns. This system offers enhanced 
      safety, comfort, and peace of mind for caregivers. It also stores historical data
      for health tracking and timely intervention. The cradle's automation reduces manual effort 
      and enhances infant care efficiency.

      <h3>ML-based Automated Road Damaged Detection Using UAV Images And DL Techniques</h3>
      <p>Automated Road Damage Detection using UAV 
      images and deep learning aims to identify cracks, potholes, 
      and other surface issues efficiently. UAVs (drones) capture 
      high-resolution road images from various angles. Deep learning models 
      like CNNs process these images to detect and classify types of 
      damage accurately. This system reduces manual inspection time 
      and increases road maintenance efficiency. 
      It supports smart infrastructure management by enabling timely 
      repairs and cost-effective operations.
